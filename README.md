### Ambiguity Function Analysis of the Frequency-Hopped Code Selection Scheme 
_Link:_ https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10371075

Presented a simplified expression for the average ambiguity function (AF) for the Freqency-Hopped Code Selection (FHCS) scheme that avoids the need to enumerate the entire symbol dictionary.
- Implemented a new performance metric that efficiently cross-compared communication symbol data and enabled easier calculation of the average zero-Doppler AF profile across the FHCS codebook.
- Prototyped virtual multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) dual-function radar-communications (DFRC) systems
- Designed simmulations synthesising realisations of Dual-Function Radar-Communications (DFRC) waveforms and capturing their zero-Doppler AF profiles.
- Interfaced with the UNSW high performance computing cluster, KATANA, to empirically generate and wrangle massive data sets.
- Showed that our expression for the simplified average AF successfully captures the zero-Doppler AF profile and gives much needed insight to how the FHCS codebook impacts the radar performance.

### Improved Implementation of the Frequency Hopped Code Selection DFRC Scheme
_Link:_ https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10149725

Proposed an enhanced version of the Frequency-Hopped Code Selection (FHCS) scheme that reduces the possibility of degenerative waveforms and ameliorates their adverse downstream effects on the resulting ambiguity function (AF), thus improving the radar performance.
- Implemented a heuristic decision-making algorithm to enable fast adjustments to the transmitted pulse.
- Generated and wrangled massive data sets using the UNSW high performance computing cluster, KATANA.
- Showed that the proposed method yielded an improvement to the AF performance and invited further development for those systems with scaled system parameters.
