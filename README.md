### Joint Radar and Communications for Frequency-Hopped MIMO Systems
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9681340

Constructed a generalised framework for Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) for Dual-Function Radar Communications (DFRC) systems employing Frequency-Hopped (FH) radar waveforms.
- Conducted an extensive literature review assessing pre-existing information embedding schemes.
- Constructed a unified framework for pre-existing FH-MIMO DFRC systems by formulating a generalised signal model enabling a variety of signalling strategies.
- Applied the unified framework to identify alternative signalling strategies, and propose hybrid information embedding schemes.
- Designed simulations synthesising numerous signalling strategies with a FH-MIMO radar system.
- Analysed data by evaluating information theoretic metrics to characterise and quantify communications performance.
- Demonstrated that the unified framework accommodates various FH-MIMO DFRC strategies, with the proposed hybrid schemes improving performance and increased communication data rates.

### Coprime beamforming: fast estimation of more sources than sensors
https://ietresearch.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1049/iet-rsn.2018.5647

Proposed and analysed the application of the fast iterative interpolated beamformer (FIIB) to the coprime DOA estimation problem and its comparison with conventional subspace-based techniques.
- Developed extensive simulations comparing the performance of the FIIB algorithm with those of root-MUSIC algorithm.
- Showed that the FIIB algorithm maintains robust frequency estimation performance across different noise distributions.
- Utilised regression metrics to evaluate radar sensing characteristics of the FIIB algorithm across multiple scenarios.
- Compared the computational complexity of the FIIB and root-MUSIC algorithms and validated the superiority of the former.
